# Chess_Analysis

This project aims to analyze all of my chess games from chess.com to better understand common patterns and areas of improvement

I downloaded my games as PGN (Portable Game Notation) files using https://www.openingtree.com/ and extract information using the python chess libary.

I downloaded an opening book from https://www.chess.com/clubs/forum/view/polyglot-opening-books and end game tablebase from https://chess.massimilianogoi.com/download/tablebases/
